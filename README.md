# KhipuReader

**An open-source tool for reading Andean khipus.**

619 khipus survive in museums around the world. Each one is a knotted-cord document from the Inca Empire — a tax record, an astronomical journal, a legal proceeding, a census, a map. We can read the numbers (Locke 1923). We are starting to read the words (ALBA syllabary, Sivan 2026).

KhipuReader translates any khipu from the [Open Khipu Repository](https://github.com/khipulab/open-khipu-repository) — install it, pick a khipu, and read what's on it.

For those who want to go further, the project also hosts a **community effort** to build the reconstructed library of the Inca Empire — one khipu at a time.

## Community progress

```
[=>                            ] 6/619 khipus analyzed (1.0%)
```

| Khipu | Type | Summary |
|-------|------|---------|
| UR006 | Astronomical journal | 24 months x 9 columns, Moon/Mars/Pleiades, ~1500 CE |
| AS076 | Naming ceremony | Identity declaration (rutuchikuy), Paris |
| HP020 | Cadastral survey | Location instruction, Pachacamac |
| AS080 | Cadastral survey | 6-step route with landmarks, Paris |
| AS077 | Zone inventory | 4 geographic zones, Paris |
| AS075 | Pilgrimage register | Pachacamac oracle ceremonies, Paris |

Run `khipu progress` to generate the full progress report, or see [PROGRESS.md](PROGRESS.md).

## Quick start

### Install

```bash
pip install khipu-reader
```

On first use, the tool automatically downloads the [Open Khipu Repository](https://github.com/khipulab/open-khipu-repository) database (~50 MB).

### Translate a khipu

```bash
khipu translate UR039 --lang en
```

### Find similar khipus

```bash
khipu suggest UR039
```

### Compare two khipus

```bash
khipu compare UR039 UR144
```

### Contribute your reading

```bash
khipu submit UR039          # generates contributions/UR039.json
# Edit the file, add your analysis
# Submit a Pull Request
```

### See what's left to do

```bash
khipu unclaimed             # 613 khipus waiting to be read
```

## How it works

Khipus encode information on two channels:

| Channel | Component | Decoding |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| **Numbers** | Simple knots (S-type) | Locke decimal system (1923) — established |
| **Text** | Long knots + figure-eight | ALBA syllabary (Sivan 2026) — proposed |

5.4% of knotted cords carry multiple long/figure-eight knots, making them incompatible with the decimal system. These "STRING" cords are candidates for textual encoding.

### The ALBA syllabary v3

| Knot | Turns | Onset | Coda | Confidence |
|------|-------|-------|------|------------|
| L0 | 0 | lla | lla | High |
| L2 | 2 | **chi** | ki | High |
| L3 | 3 | ma | ma | High |
| L4 | 4 | ka | ka | High |
| L5 | 5 | ta | ta | High |
| L6 | 6 | pa | pa | High |
| L7 | 7 | **wa** | y | High |
| L8 | 8 | **cha** | na | High |
| L9 | 9 | pi | pi | High |
| L10 | 10 | si | si | Medium |
| L11 | 11 | ti | ti | Low |
| L12 | 12 | ku | ku | Low |
| E | fig-8 | — | qa | High |

16 effective symbols. Three onset variants (wa/y, cha/na, chi/ki) follow natural phonological patterns.

> **Research hypothesis.** The ALBA syllabary is a proposed decipherment (p = 0.001) — not a confirmed reading system. Use with scholarly caution.

## How to contribute

You don't need to be a Quechua speaker. There are 4 levels:

### Level 1 — Triage
Run `khipu translate` and describe what you see: "looks like a cadastre", "purely numerical", "lots of kinship words". Anyone can do this.

### Level 2 — Context
Research the provenance. What site is it from? What museum? Are there other khipus from the same place? Historians and archaeologists shine here.

### Level 3 — Interpretation
Propose column names, identify the document type, cross-reference with colonial sources. Linguists and Andean specialists needed.

### Level 4 — Reconstruction
Create the "library" Excel file — the khipu as the Inca would have written it in a spreadsheet. The expert level.

### The workflow

```bash
khipu submit UR039                    # 1. Generate template
nano contributions/UR039.json         # 2. Add your analysis
git add contributions/UR039.json      # 3. Commit
# Submit a Pull Request                # 4. Community reviews
```
