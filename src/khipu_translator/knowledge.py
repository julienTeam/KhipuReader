Knowledge database — what we know about specific khipus.

  Monthly astronomical observation journal kept at Leymebamba.
  874 cords = largest translated khipu in the corpus.
  9-column standardized format, 24 monthly observations.
  Date: June 1473 CE (multi-object astronomical dating, p=0.0002).

DATING
  Multi-object method: Mars (35%), Jupiter (20%), Saturn (15%),
  Scorpio/Antares (15%), Pleiades (15%) correlated simultaneously
  with UR006's 24 monthly section totals.
  Best fit: June 1473 (r_combined=0.703). Permutation test: p=0.0002.
  Bonferroni correction (0.05/86 = 0.0006): SURVIVES (p < threshold).
  Historical context: Tupac Inca conquered Leymebamba ~1470-1475.
  The catalog documents June 1473 to May 1475 = consolidation period.
  Cross-validation: UR220 (Ica) = 1473/02 by header dating = same year,
  different site, different method.

FORMAT
  Alternating structure: large data clusters (daily detail) separated by
  summary cords with 9 L2 subsidiaries (monthly totals).
  Column names written in months 3-5 at odd positions (1,3,5,7,9),
  then never repeated — headers written once like a lab notebook.
  Month 5 is a TOTAL row (P8=521 = sum of all other Moon values +/-1).

THE 9 COLUMNS
  P1 = Observation count (small integers 1-7)
  P2 = Binary flag: observation performed yes/no
  P3 = Position/duration — Pleiades tracking from month 5
  P4 = Secondary count
  P5 = Mars events (months 1-4), then heliacal rising/setting (months 5+)
  P6 = Additional count/flag
  P7 = Dark constellations (Milky Way) — correlated with P8 (r=0.90)
  P8 = Moon (Mama Killa) — never changes assignment
  P9 = Clear nights available (mode=20 = 67% = Leymebamba climate)

CELESTIAL LABELS (10 identified, glossary v3)
  HIGH:   mama=Moon, kama=Mars(events), qaqa=dark constell., kaki=Pleiades,

5 SECTION-LEVEL CROSS-VALIDATIONS (June 1473)
  1. Section 1 (Jun 73): P8=13 vs 12-day Pleiades invisibility (diff 1 day)
  2. Section 12 (May 74): Pleiades invisible (elong=-2 deg)
  3. Section 9 (Feb 74): Mars at opposition (+161 deg) = highest total (83)
  4. Sections 17-24: Mars near Sun (16-31 deg) = lowest totals (11-39)

  Phases 3-5: 9x figure-eight (value=1 each)
    → 9 testimony votes: GUILTY.
  Phase 6: [13, 21, 6, 5, 12] + mama(mother)
    → Compensation amounts due for the dead mother.
  Phases 7-8: [4,3,3,2,3,3] [5,3,3,2,3,5] [5,2,2,1,1,3]
    → Payment schedule details (symmetric registers).
  Phase 9: papi=10(father?) + [9,10,9,7,6,11,17,6,4,5,7] + 116(total)
    → Closure. Father receives compensation. Final total = 116.

COMPARATIVE EVIDENCE
  UR110 and UR112 have same violence+kinship pattern (maka+kaka+mama)
  but WITHOUT tana/mana/llapa/S0 → assault cases, not murder.
  Their compensation totals (169, 188) are 4x LOWER than UR1091 (682).
  The death markers are what distinguish murder from assault.

NOTE ON THE WORD "DEATH"
  The Quechua word wañuy (to die) appears to be unwritable in ALBA
  because the phoneme ñ (palatal nasal) has no known knot encoding.
  If correct, this would require the scribe to use a periphrasis such
  as "tana mana" (the support is no more) instead of a single word.
  This is a tentative observation — the reading of UR1091 as a murder
  case is one plausible interpretation among others.""",
