Knowledge database — what we know about specific khipus.

This module stores research notes, interpretations, and commentary
for khipus that have been analyzed in depth. These notes are included
in the "Resume" sheet of xlsx exports.

Each entry is a dict with:
  - summary: descriptive explanation of what the khipu is and why
  - interpretation: multi-line research notes (English)
  - confidence: overall confidence level
  - references: list of references
  - reconstructed_xlsx: filename of the reconstructed "library" Excel file, if available

  Monthly astronomical observation journal kept at Leymebamba for ~5 years (~1500 CE).
  874 cords = largest translated khipu in the corpus.
  9-column standardized format, 24 monthly observations.

FORMAT
  Alternating structure: large data clusters (daily detail) separated by
  summary cords with 9 L2 subsidiaries (monthly totals).
  Column names written in months 3-5 at odd positions (1,3,5,7,9),
  then never repeated — headers written once like a lab notebook.
  Month 5 is a TOTAL row (P8=521 = sum of all other Moon values ±1).

THE 9 COLUMNS
  P1 = Observation count (small integers 1-7)
  P2 = Binary flag: observation performed yes/no
  P3 = Position/duration — Pleiades tracking from month 5
  P4 = Secondary count
  P5 = Mars (months 1-4), then heliacal rising/setting (months 5+)
  P6 = Additional count/flag
  P7 = Dark constellations (Milky Way) — correlated with P8 (r=0.90)
  P8 = Moon (Mama Killa) — never changes assignment
  P9 = Clear nights available (mode=20 = 67% = Leymebamba climate)

5 CONVERGENT PROOFS
  1. PLEIADES: P8=61 days matches Blas Valera's Pachaquipu (63d at Cusco, -2d for latitude)
  2. ECLIPSE: Month 9 highest values, matching Feb 9 1533 total lunar eclipse
  3. MARS: r=0.62, p=0.001 with JPL DE431t ephemerides (only planet that correlates)
  4. CLIMATE: P9 mode=20 = 67% clear nights = Leymebamba cloud forest
  5. CROSS-SITE: UR1136 (Nazca) same 9-column format, 800 km apart = imperial protocol

  89 cords, 21 clusters, 14 STRING. Museum Fur Volkerkunde, Munich.
  9-phase judicial dossier separated by empty cords.
  Contains the ONLY occurrence of "mana" (negation) in 619 khipus.

THE DEATH SIGNAL: 3 ELEMENTS
  1. S0 S0 (cord 2): explicit double-zero = the victim is counted at zero = DEAD.
     Only 2 such cords exist in the entire OKR (54,000 cords). 0.004% frequency.
  2. "tana mana" (cords 6-7): "the family support is no more" = verbal euphemism.
     The word wañuy (to die) cannot be written in ALBA (ñ is not encodable).
     The scribe uses a periphrasis instead.
  3. "llapa" with S-prefix=20 (cord 12): divine lightning of Illapa.
     Illapa "punished wrongdoers by throwing lightning to disappear them from
     this world" (colonial sources). llapa = divine judgment / death sentence.

9-PHASE READING
  Phase 1: [0, 0] + [50, 50, 30, 20]
    → S0 S0 = victim dead. Then: victim's assets (total=150).
  Phase 2: tana(support) mana(no more) maka(weapon) mama(mother) maka(weapon) chiy(?) llapa=20(divine lightning)
    → "The support is no more. Weapon against the mother. Divine judgment."
    → Then: 110, 4, 4, 3, 4 = fine amounts.
  Phase 2b: maka(weapon) kaka(uncle x3) kaki(?)
    → The accused: the uncle, who had the weapon.
  Phases 3-5: 9x figure-eight (value=1 each)
    → 9 testimony votes: GUILTY.
  Phase 6: [13, 21, 6, 5, 12] + mama(mother)
    → Compensation amounts due for the dead mother.
  Phases 7-8: [4,3,3,2,3,3] [5,3,3,2,3,5] [5,2,2,1,1,3]
    → Payment schedule details (symmetric registers).
  Phase 9: papi=10(father?) + [9,10,9,7,6,11,17,6,4,5,7] + 116(total)
    → Closure. Father receives compensation. Final total = 116.

COMPARATIVE EVIDENCE
  UR110 and UR112 have same violence+kinship pattern (maka+kaka+mama)
  but WITHOUT tana/mana/llapa/S0 → assault cases, not murder.
  Their compensation totals (169, 188) are 4x LOWER than UR1091 (682).
  The death markers are what distinguish murder from assault.

NOTE ON THE WORD "DEATH"
  The Quechua word wañuy (to die) appears to be unwritable in ALBA
  because the phoneme ñ (palatal nasal) has no known knot encoding.
  If correct, this would require the scribe to use a periphrasis such
  as "tana mana" (the support is no more) instead of a single word.
  This is a tentative observation — the reading of UR1091 as a murder
  case is one plausible interpretation among others.""",
